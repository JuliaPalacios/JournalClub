# All things Bayes 
*Time*: Tuesday, 2:00 pm - 3:00 pm (once every other week or by demand)

*Location*: Fishbowl

Bayesian modeling of massive data is computationally challenging and some algorithms such as ABC and MCMC are notoriously expensive. Variational Autoencoders and Variational Bayes attempt to speed computation and are gaining popularity. 

*Schedule* (Open an issue if you want to suggest a paper to read):
