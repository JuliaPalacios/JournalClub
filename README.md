# All things Bayes and MCMC
*Time*: Wednesday, 3:00 pm - 4:00 pm

*Location*: Fishbowl

Bayesian modeling of massive data is computationally challenging and some algorithms such as ABC and MCMC are notoriously expensive. We will discuss recently proposed strategies to overcome this problem.   

*Schedule* (Open an issue if you want to suggest a paper to read):
